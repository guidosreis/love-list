# etventure Front-End Challenge

This is the implementation of the frontend challenge for a role in Etventure. It was developed with angular v6.

## Requirements
* NodeJs

## How to install
```bash
$ npm install
```

## How to execute
```bash
$ npm start
```

## How to run the tests
```bash
$ npm test
```

## Observation
At a random time between 1000 and 5000 ms, one random thing is rated, adding 1 to its rating

I've implemented two new features:

* Add new thing that I love
* Remove anything that I don't love
